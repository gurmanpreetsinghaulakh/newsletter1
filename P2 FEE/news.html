                    <p>NEW DELHI: When they play Zimbabwe in the fourth Twenty20 International on Saturday in Harare, a number of young Indian players who are returning to their best will be keen to win the series and start a new chapter in the shortest format.
                        The Shubman Gill-led team found its groove in the second and third games to establish a commanding 2-1 lead with convincing victories, following an unexpected loss in the opening encounter.
                        A series victory against Zimbabwe will not be highly regarded in the current cricket hierarchy, but it will undoubtedly inspire some young players who are eager to lead the team after some of the game's greatest players depart.
                        Nobody makes a stronger case for that scenario than Abhishek Sharma and Washington Sundar, according to PTI.

                        Announcing the decision, Union home minister Amit Shah said the move "will commemorate the massive contributions of all those who endured the inhuman pains of the 1975 Emergency".
                        "On June 25, 1975, the then PM Indira Gandhi, in a brazen display of a dictatorial mindset, strangled the soul of our democracy by imposing the Emergency on the nation.

                        A senior member of the cabin crew noticed smoke emanating from one of the seats and approached the passenger, who directed her attention to a different seat, the official stated.
                        "The passenger, Kanishksingh Rajput, admitted to smoking an e-cigarette," he said.

                        According to a report in The Telegraph, one of the frontrunners to replace Gambhir as KKR's mentor is South African great and the franchise's former coach Jacques Kallis. While Chandrakant Pandit is certain to remain the team's head coach, Kallis's appointment may see him performing the same role as Gambhir.

                    <p>NEW DELHI: Before officially stepping into his role as India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir encountered a minor setback. Reports indicate that Gambhir's recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
                        Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India's head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game. Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.</p>
